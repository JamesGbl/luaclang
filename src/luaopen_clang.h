/*
Luaclang is a module (loadable library) for the Lua programming language (www.lua.org) providing bindings to the LLVM/Clang APIs (www.llvm.org), in order to control LLVM/Clang from within Lua scripts.
Luaclang is built against the LLVM 2.6 stable release, for Lua 5.1.
Luaclang aims to closely follow the LLVM API, but making use of Lua idioms where possible. 

Luaclang is released under the MIT open source license
